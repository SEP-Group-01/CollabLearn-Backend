   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Restore previous version:**

   ```bash
   git checkout previous-stable-tag
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Database rollback (if needed):**

   ```bash
   npm run migration:rollback
   ```

4. **Verify rollback:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

### Rollback Triggers
