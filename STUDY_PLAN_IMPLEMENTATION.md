- Select entire workspace (auto-selects all subscribed threads)
- Select individual threads
- Select individual resources
- Checkboxes with indeterminate state
- Count indicators
- Expandable accordions
- Resource type and duration display

#### 4. StudyCalendar Component

- Week-by-week view
- 7 columns (days of week)
- Visual timeline for each day
- Task cards positioned by time
- Color-coded (study vs revision)
- Hover tooltips with full details
- Click to open task details dialog
- Mark as completed/skipped
- Rate sessions (1-5 stars)
- Add notes
- Progress tracking

#### 5. StudyPlanGenerationPage (Main Integration)

- 3-step wizard:
  1. Configure Time Slots
  2. Select Resources
  3. Generate & View Plan
- Stepper navigation
- Max weeks slider (1-12 weeks)
- Revision ratio slider (0-50%)
- Summary statistics
- Drop plan with confirmation
- Error handling
- Loading states

## 📋 Configuration Notes

### Backend

1. **Kafka Broker URL**: Currently set to `localhost:9093` in `config.py`
   - Change to `kafka:9092` when dockerizing
   - See comment in config.py

2. **Environment Variables Required**:

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<your-service-key>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
   ```

3. **Database**: Run `study_plan_schema.sql` migration

### Frontend

1. **API URL**: Set in `.env`

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

2. **Authentication**: Uses localStorage token

## 🚀 How to Run

### Backend

```bash
cd CollabLearn-Backend/python/study_plan_service/src
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Or with Python module:

```bash
cd CollabLearn-Backend/python/study_plan_service/src
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd CollabLearn-Frontend/client
npm run dev
```

## 📊 API Flow

1. **Create Slots**: User adds time slots → API Gateway → Kafka → Python Service → Database
2. **Select Resources**: User selects from workspaces → Loaded from database
3. **Generate Plan**:
   - Frontend sends slots + resources
   - API Gateway forwards via Kafka
   - Python service generates optimized plan (OpenAI or rule-based)
   - Creates study_plan and scheduled_tasks in database
   - Marks slots as occupied
   - Returns schedule to frontend
4. **Update Progress**: User marks tasks complete → Updates task and resource progress
5. **Drop Plan**: User drops plan → Deletes tasks → Frees slots

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Modern & Stylish**: Material-UI components with custom styling
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Intuitive**: 3-step wizard guides users
- **Visual**: Timeline representation for easy understanding
- **Feedback**: Loading states, errors, and success messages
- **Smart**: AI-powered with intelligent fallback

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Calendar sync (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Mobile app
- Notifications/Reminders
- Analytics dashboard
- Study streak tracking
- Collaborative study plans
- Import/Export plans
- Template plans

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create time slots for different days
- [ ] Test slot overlap detection
- [ ] Test slot deletion (free vs occupied)
- [ ] Select workspaces/threads/resources
- [ ] Generate plan with different configurations
- [ ] View generated plan in calendar
- [ ] Mark tasks as completed
- [ ] Rate sessions
- [ ] Drop study plan
- [ ] Verify slots are freed after dropping

## 📝 Notes

- Minimum slot duration: 60 minutes
- Time slots are weekly recurring
- Revision scheduled in later weeks (not week 1)
- OpenAI API key optional (falls back to rule-based)
- All components are fully type-safe (TypeScript)
- Error handling throughout
- Database triggers manage slot availability automatically
