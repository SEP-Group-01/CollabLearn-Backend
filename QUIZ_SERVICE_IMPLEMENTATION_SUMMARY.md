# Quiz Service Backend Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Alignment

- **Fixed table references**: Changed from `quiz_options` to `answer_option` to match your schema
- **Updated column names**: Used `allocated_time` instead of `time_allocated`, `answer` instead of `text`, etc.
- **Added proper foreign key handling**: Updated all queries to use correct table and column names
- **Fixed attempt tracking**: Modified to work with your simpler schema without status fields

### 2. Quiz Service Controller Updates

- **Added `check-admin-or-moderator` message pattern** as requested
- **Implemented permission checking** for thread admins and workspace admins
- All existing endpoints maintained for backward compatibility

### 3. Quiz Service Implementation Fixes

- **`createQuiz`**: Now properly uses `answer_option` table with sequence letters (a, b, c, d...)
- **`listQuizzes`**: Updated queries to use correct table relationships
- **`getQuiz`**: Fixed to return data in expected format for frontend
- **`startQuiz`**: Now calculates attempt numbers correctly and handles time tracking
- **`attemptQuiz`**: Completely rewritten to work with `user_answer` table and your schema
- **`checkAdminOrModerator`**: New method to verify user permissions

### 4. API Gateway Controller Enhancements

- **Added `/quizzes/:id/start`**: Endpoint to start a quiz attempt
- **Added `/quizzes/:id/active-attempt`**: Get current active attempt
- **Added `/quizzes/:id/attempts/me`**: Get my attempts for a quiz
- **Fixed authentication**: All endpoints now properly validate tokens
- **Updated submit attempt**: Now works with the correct DTO structure

### 5. Key Schema Differences Handled

Your schema uses:

- `answer_option` table instead of `quiz_options`
- `answer_sequence_letter` (a, b, c...) instead of option IDs
- `user_answer` table to store responses
- `quiz_attempt` without status/session tracking
- Time stored as PostgreSQL TIME type

## Recommended Database Changes

See `database/migrations/004_fix_quiz_schema.sql` for:

- Adding missing `workspace_id` to quizzes table
- Adding performance indexes
- Fixing typo: `attempt_nummber` â†’ `attempt_number`
- Adding data integrity constraints

## API Endpoints Now Available

### Quiz Management

- `GET /quizzes` - List all quizzes
- `GET /threads/:threadId/quizzes` - Get quizzes for a thread
- `POST /threads/:threadId/quizzes/create` - Create quiz in thread
- `GET /quizzes/:id` - Get specific quiz

### Quiz Taking

- `POST /quizzes/:id/start` - Start a quiz attempt
- `GET /quizzes/:id/active-attempt` - Get active attempt
- `POST /quizzes/:id/attempts` - Submit quiz answers
- `GET /quizzes/:id/attempts/me` - Get my attempts
- `GET /quizzes/:id/attempts` - Get all attempts (admin)

## Frontend Integration

The implementation now properly supports the frontend API calls shown in `quizApi.ts`:

- All endpoint URLs match expected patterns
- Authentication headers handled correctly
- Data formats align with frontend expectations
- Error handling improved with proper HTTP status codes

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- All quiz attempt tracking now works with your simplified schema
- Time calculations handle both creation time and allocated time limits
- User answers are stored with sequence letters as per your schema design
