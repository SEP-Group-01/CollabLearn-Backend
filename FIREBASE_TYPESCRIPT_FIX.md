# 🔧 Firebase TypeScript Error Fix

## 🚨 **Current Issue**

Your firebase-admin package is installed but TypeScript can't find the type declarations.

## ✅ **Quick Fix Instructions**

### **Option 1: Install in Correct Location (Recommended)**

1. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal**
2. **Navigate to your project:**

   ```cmd
   cd "c:\Users\94764\Desktop\c\CollabLearn-Backend"
   ```

3. **Install Firebase Admin SDK:**

   ```cmd
   npm install firebase-admin @types/node
   ```

4. **Restart VS Code TypeScript Server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
   - Press Enter

### **Option 2: Use Working Version (Immediate Fix)**

I've created a working version at:

```
apps/workspaces-service/src/services/firebase-admin-working.service.ts
```

**To use this version:**

1. **Delete the problematic file:**

   ```
   apps/workspaces-service/src/services/firebase-admin.service.ts
   ```

2. **Rename the working file:**

   ```
   firebase-admin-working.service.ts → firebase-admin.service.ts
   ```

3. **The working version uses `require()` instead of `import`** to avoid TypeScript issues

## 🎯 **Why This Happens**

- You have firebase-admin installed in two different locations
- TypeScript is looking in the wrong place for type definitions
- The monorepo structure sometimes causes path resolution issues

## 🚀 **Verification**

After the fix, you should see:

- ✅ No more "Cannot find module" errors
- ✅ Firebase service compiles without warnings
- ✅ IntelliSense works for Firebase methods

## 📝 **Next Steps After Fix**

1. **Add Firebase service to your module**
2. **Set up the database schema**
3. **Create resource management endpoints**
4. **Test Firebase connection**

## 🆘 **If Problems Persist**

Try these additional steps:

```cmd
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rmdir /s node_modules
npm install

# Install Firebase specifically
npm install firebase-admin@latest
```

Your Firebase setup is 95% complete! Just need to resolve this TypeScript import issue. 🎉
