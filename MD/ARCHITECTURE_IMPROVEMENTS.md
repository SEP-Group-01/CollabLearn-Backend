# Improved Real-time Architecture Issues and Solutions

## Current Architecture Problems

### 1. **TCP-Only Communication**

- ❌ Gateway ↔ Document Service uses only TCP
- ❌ Real-time updates go through slow request-response pattern
- ❌ No direct WebSocket bridge between services
- ❌ Latency issues for collaborative editing

### 2. **No Redis Integration**

- ❌ Document state stored in memory (single instance)
- ❌ User sessions not shared across service instances
- ❌ No distributed awareness/presence management
- ❌ WebSocket connections can't scale horizontally

### 3. **Scaling Limitations**

- ❌ Can't run multiple document service instances
- ❌ Gateway WebSocket adapter not distributed
- ❌ No shared state between service replicas

## Improved Architecture Solution

### 1. **Multi-Transport Communication**

```
Frontend WebSocket ↔ Gateway WebSocket ↔ Redis Pub/Sub ↔ Document Service
                              ↕
                        TCP (for REST operations)
```

### 2. **Redis Integration Points**

- **Document State**: Yjs documents stored in Redis
- **User Presence**: Awareness data in Redis with TTL
- **WebSocket Sessions**: Distributed session management
- **Pub/Sub**: Real-time event broadcasting
- **Caching**: Document metadata and permissions

### 3. **Service Communication**

- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time collaboration through Redis Pub/Sub
- **TCP Messages**: Traditional CRUD operations
- **Direct Redis**: State persistence and retrieval

## Benefits of New Architecture

✅ **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket events bypass TCP latency
✅ **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple service instances with shared Redis state
✅ **Fault Tolerance**: Redis persistence and clustering
✅ **Session Management**: Distributed user sessions
✅ **Load Balancing**: WebSocket connections distributed across gateways
